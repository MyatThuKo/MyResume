                            Hey there, I am Myat Thu Ko, you can call me Myat. I am a computer science student in New York, NY and
                            am originally from<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar" target="_blank"> Myanmar</a>.
                            I am a dedicated student working towards my dream of becoming a software engineer at FAANG.

                        <p>
                            Currently, I am part of the IT team in <a href="https://wecodeucate.org/" target="_blank">Codeucate (Chicago, US)</a> and trying to solidify my knowledge on React and SwiftUI.
                            During 2020 quarantine, I attended multiple virtual hackathons where I have had met a lot of new friends and gained new experiences.
                        </p>
                        <h2><span>Family</span></h2>
                        <p>
                            I am the eldest sibling in my family and have one little sister.
                            My family acts as a big part of who I am and they play a major role in my life.
                            My dream is always to support them where my parents don't have to work after 60 years old.
